# ESP-NOW-Crane

This is an plastic crane toy which was driven and powered from a wired controller. My daughter kept pulling the crane over, so I decided to swap it for a wireless controller. As I didn't want it dependant on a WiFi access point I opted to the use ESP-NOW features built into the ESP8266 (and ESP32).

It's 2025 and the old crane was killed in a big tumble....so I bought a new one and it was going to be controlled via MQTT, but it worked out to a bit slow to respond...leading to confusion.
So we'll vibe code this old code into 2025, using deep sleep on an ESP32 to conserve power on the transmitter!
